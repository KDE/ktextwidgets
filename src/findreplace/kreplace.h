/**
 * @class KReplace kreplace.h <KReplace>
 *
 * @brief A generic implementation of the "replace" function.
 *
 * @author S.R.Haque <srhaque@iee.org>, David Faure <faure@kde.org>
 *
 * \b Detail:
 *
 * This class includes prompt handling etc. Also provides some
 * static functions which can be used to create custom behavior
 * instead of using the class directly.
 *
 * \b Example:
 *
 * To use the class to implement a complete replace feature:
 *
 * In the slot connect to the replace action, after using KReplaceDialog:
 * \code
 *
 *  // This creates a replace-on-prompt dialog if needed.
 *  m_replace = new KReplace(pattern, replacement, options, this);
 *
 *  // Connect signals to code which handles highlighting of found text, and
 *  // on-the-fly replacement.
 *  connect(m_replace, &KFind::textFound, this, [this](const QString &text, int matchingIndex, int matchedLength) {
 *      slotHighlight(text, matchingIndex, matchedLength);
 *  });
 *  // Connect findNext signal - called when pressing the button in the dialog
 *  connect( m_replace, SIGNAL( findNext() ),
 *          this, SLOT( slotReplaceNext() ) );
 *  // Connect to the textReplaced() signal - emitted when a replacement is done
 *  connect( m_replace, &KReplace::textReplaced, this, [this](const QString &text, int replacementIndex, int replacedLength, int matchedLength) {
 *      slotReplace(text, replacementIndex, replacedLength, matchedLength);
 *  });
 * \endcode
 *  Then initialize the variables determining the "current position"
 *  (to the cursor, if the option FromCursor is set,
 *   to the beginning of the selection if the option SelectedText is set,
 *   and to the beginning of the document otherwise).
 *  Initialize the "end of search" variables as well (end of doc or end of selection).
 *  Swap begin and end if FindBackwards.
 *  Finally, call slotReplaceNext();
 *
 * \code
 *  void slotReplaceNext()
 *  {
 *      KFind::Result res = KFind::NoMatch;
 *      while ( res == KFind::NoMatch && <position not at end> ) {
 *          if ( m_replace->needData() )
 *              m_replace->setData( <current text fragment> );
 *
 *          // Let KReplace inspect the text fragment, and display a dialog if a match is found
 *          res = m_replace->replace();
 *
 *          if ( res == KFind::NoMatch ) {
 *              <Move to the next text fragment, honoring the FindBackwards setting for the direction>
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      if ( res == KFind::NoMatch ) // i.e. at end
 *          <Call either  m_replace->displayFinalDialog(); delete m_replace; m_replace = nullptr;
 *           or           if ( m_replace->shouldRestart() ) { reinit (w/o FromCursor) and call slotReplaceNext(); }
 *                        else { m_replace->closeReplaceNextDialog(); }>
 *  }
 * \endcode
 *
 *  Don't forget delete m_find in the destructor of your class,
 *  unless you gave it a parent widget on construction.
 *
